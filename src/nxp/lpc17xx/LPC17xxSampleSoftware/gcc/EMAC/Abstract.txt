This project is migrated from Keil MCB1700 Demo code.
It can run at Keil MCB1700 board with LPC1768.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz

The web page shows the values of analog input(AN2).
This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
some restrictions:
- only one active TCP session at any one time
- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
It is only available in German language. 

The easyWEB project is set up for one target:
  FLASH:  Settings for Keil MCB1700 Board. 
            Program code is loaded into on-chip flash
